                <h4>Simple decorations</h4>
                <p>
                  A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People
                  either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't
                  have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help
                  draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like
                  never before.
